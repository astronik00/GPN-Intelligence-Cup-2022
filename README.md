My solution for Java task using VK API

# How to run
You can run application in two ways: run in IDE or run Dockerfile and open one in the container. 

If you want to make JUnit tests work, than don't forget to open 'application.properties' file and write your service token to 'vk.api.config.access_token' variable.
